## Background

It is often repeated that air travel is safer than travel by car. Is this true? Can it be demonstrated using data? This project synthesizes a variety of data sources in order to give detail and answer questions around airline safety and revenue.

## Problem statement

Is air travel safer than travel by car?

## What data

See the first six lines of "Files included" above.

## What methods

Data is gathered from disparate sources, relevant metrics cmoputed, and results displayed in data visuals to answer questions around air travel safety.

### Technology

The data was handled and synthesized using jupyter notebooks and google sheets. Graphics were generated in R, Tableau, jupyter notebooks (with python), and google sheets.

## What conclusions

Air travel is substantially safer than travel by car.

## What questions remain

This study can be extended by searching for limited circumstances under which the conclusion does not hold. For example, perhaps in daytime travel with fair weather and with a driver between the ages of 25 and 55, car travel and air travel will be comparable in safety.
